Container7: @here - 'this' seems to change from the Scene to the Window object in my code. I don't know what would cause it to change.
[8:39 AM] Container7:

[8:40 AM] Container7: Both of those are the  output of console.log(this); in two different spots in the same code
[8:40 AM] Container7: My goal is to reference the physics system in the second spot, but I'm not sure how to do that without using 'this'.
[8:40 AM] Container7: (arcade physics)
[8:44 AM] Antriel: I recommend reading up about scope in JavaScript.
[8:44 AM] Container7: Thank you!

if we declare a variable ANYWHERE in the code without 'var' in the declaration then it becomes global, cool!

Any functions defined within another can access the 'outer' function(s) variables.

But the outer function can't access the inner function variables.

3 ways to call functions in javascript

	Method

		function hats() {

			console.log(this); // global object

		};


	On It's Own

		myhats = {};

		myhats.foo = function () {

			console.log(this); // points to myhats object

		}

	As an Event Handler

		var hat = document.getElementById("myHatID");
		hat.addEventListener("click", function() {

			console.log(this); // points to hat

		}, false);
